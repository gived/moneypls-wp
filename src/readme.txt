== Description ==

= MoneyPls: request donations nicely =
MoneyPls is built by Gived, a London-based startup, that helps creators monetise their passion. This plugin makes it simple to set up MoneyPls on your WordPress blog.
To use this plugin, you must first set up a MoneyPls campaign on https://gived.org/moneypls/create. Follow the instructions and copy the generated ID into the plugin config panel.

= TAKING CARE OF YOUR WORDPRESS BLOG READERS =
MoneyPls lets you ask your audience for money in a friendly way that converts better and isn't pushy. Our proprietary algorithm decides the best time to ask your visitors for money. This means requests convert better than a static donate button, and interrupt your users less.
MoneyPls offers:
- A powerful and easy way for your audience to show their support
- An integrated and intelligent donation popup
- Access to the whole Gived ecosystem (e.g. advanced campaigning tools)

= Pricing =
We charge 4% on each transaction (+ card processing fees).
For more details, see https://gived.org/pricing

= FAQ =
- Will it slow my site down?
  No. We use special ‘async’ and ‘defer’ properties on our script tags so MoneyPls only loads in the background after everything else has loaded.
- How can I get support?
  You can email joe@gived.org for support, we’re happy to help and will respond within 1 working day
- Who uses MoneyPls?
  MoneyPls is used by charities, individuals, and blogs. It’s a new tool, but is growing quickly.
- How often do you update the plugin?
